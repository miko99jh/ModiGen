# ModiGen
This is a Large Language Model-based workflow for multi-task Modelica code generation.

It provides an **end-to-end pipeline** for processing, validating, and analyzing **Modelica code** generated by large language models (LLMs). 

### **Pipeline Components**
- **Text Processing**: Extracting Modelica models from generated text.
- **Model Validation**: Checking syntax, simulating models with OpenModelica (OMPython).
- **Results Analysis**: Evaluating model correctness and simulation outcomes.

### **Key Features**
- **GraphRAG**: Constructing and indexing **attribute graphs** to represent the structure and relationships of Modelica components. This improves model organization, dependency analysis, and retrieval efficiency.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Extracting errors and generating refined prompts. The code after validation can run the extract_error in feedback for error extraction and new prompt generation.

Additionally, our fine-tuning relies on the LLaMA-Factory.
