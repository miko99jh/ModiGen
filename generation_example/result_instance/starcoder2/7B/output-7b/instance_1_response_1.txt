Below I will provide Modelica model and Prompt for you to help me generate the corresponding model.
Modelica model:```
within IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.IntegerType;
model Mult "Multiplication of two integer numbers"
  extends
    IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.IntegerType.Interfaces.IntSimpleOperation;
equation
  if Ts > 0 then
    when sample(0,Ts) then
      y = u1 * u2;
    end when;
  else
     y = u1 * u2;
  end if;
end Mult;
```
Model description:
Model of a multiplication of two integers.
The output ( y ) is the multiplication of the inputs ( u1, u2 ) signals.
    y = u1 * u2
Depending on the value of the sampling time (Ts), the model has two different behaviours:
Ts > 0
it behaves as a discrete time system,
Ts <= 0
it behaves as a continous time system. No delay is introduced and events are generated when the output changes (this mode reduces the simulation time)

Prompt:
Use this model to compute the multiplication of two signals u1 and u2, where u1 has the value 5 and u2 has the value 10. Please help me generate this modelica model and you don't need to provide "within".

Response:```
model Test_Mult
  IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.IntegerType.Mult mult1(u1=5,u2=10,Ts=0.1);
