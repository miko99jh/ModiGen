Generate a Modelica function named `moh` to calculate the minute of an hour given a specific time. The function should correctly handle the conversion from a continuous time input to discrete minute output, factoring in the starting hour, minute, and second. The input parameters 't', 'hour_start', 'min_start', and 'sec_start' represent the current time in seconds and the initial hour, minute, and second respectively. The output 'y' should represent the minute of the current hour, ranging from 0 to 59.   Use `AES.Functions.sod` and `AES.Functions.hod` to calculate seconds of the day and hour of the day as intermediate steps(represented by two protection variables s and h), ensuring accurate minute calculation within an hour frame.

//modelica
```function moh "minute of hour"
input Real t "time in seconds";
input Real hour_start "starting hour";
input Real min_start "starting minute";
input Real sec_start "starting second";
output Real y "minute of hour";
protected
Real s "seconds of day";
Real h "hour of day";

equation
s = sod(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start);
h = hod(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start);
y = mod(s, 60);
end moh;
```

//python
```python
def moh(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start):
    s = sod(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start)
    h = hod(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start)
    y = s % 60
    return y
```

## 3. `hod`

Generate a Modelica function named `hod` to calculate the hour of the day given a specific time. The function should correctly handle the conversion from a continuous time input to discrete hour output, factoring in the starting hour, minute, and second. The input parameters 't', 'hour_start','min_start', and'sec_start' represent the current time in seconds and the initial hour, minute, and second respectively. The output 'y' should represent the hour of the current day, ranging from 0 to 23.   Use `AES.Functions.sod` to calculate seconds of the day as an intermediate step(represented by a protection variable s), ensuring accurate hour calculation within a day frame.

//modelica
```function hod "hour of day"
input Real t "time in seconds";
input Real hour_start "
