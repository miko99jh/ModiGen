Generate a Modelica model for a comparison function that implements 'not equal (!=)' logic. The model should be named `NotEqual` and it should extend from the `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison` model. The inputs `u1` and `u2` are real signals, and the output 'y' is a Boolean. The input and output exist in `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison` and does not need to be redeclared. In The equation section, the model includes a sample time parameter 'Ts', which when greater than 0, triggers the comparison at regular intervals; otherwise, the comparison is continuous. If the absolute difference between u1 and u2 is less than a small threshold (eps), the output y should be false; otherwise, it should be true.

//modelica
```model NotEqual "Implements the 'not equal' logic"
extends IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison;
Real u1 "Input signal 1";
Real u2 "Input signal 2";
Boolean y "Output";
parameter Real eps = 1e-6 "Threshold for equality";
parameter Real Ts = 0 "Sample time for comparison";
equation
y = (abs(u1-u2) > eps);
end NotEqual;
```

## 1.2.2.2.2. Real Comparison

Generate a Modelica model for a comparison function that implements 'less than (<)' logic. The model should be named `LessThan` and it should extend from the `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison` model. The inputs `u1` and `u2` are real signals, and the output 'y' is a Boolean. The input and output exist in `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison` and does not need to be redeclared. In The equation section, the model includes a sample time parameter 'Ts', which when greater than 0, triggers the comparison at regular intervals; otherwise, the comparison is continuous. If u1 is less than u2, the output y should be true; otherwise, it should be false.

//modelica
```model LessThan "Implements the 'less than' logic"
extends IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison;
Real u1 "Input signal 1";
Real u2 "Input signal 2";
Boolean y "Output";
parameter Real Ts = 0 "Sample time for comparison";
equation
y = (u1 < u2);
end LessThan;
```
