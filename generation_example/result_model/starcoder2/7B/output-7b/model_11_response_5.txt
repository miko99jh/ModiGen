Generate a Modelica model for a component that performs a 'greater than or equal to' (>=) comparison between two integer inputs. The model should be named `GreatEq` and it should extend from the `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.IntegerType.Interfaces.IntComparison` model. The inputs `u1` and `u2` are integers, and the output 'y' is a Boolean. The input and output exist in `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.IntegerType.Interfaces.IntComparison` and does not need to be redeclared. In The equation section, the model includes a sample time parameter 'Ts', which when greater than 0, triggers the comparison at regular intervals; otherwise, the comparison is continuous. The value of `y` is `true` if `u1 >= u2`, otherwise `false`.

//modelica
```model GreatEq "Greater than or equal to (>=) comparison between two integer inputs"
extends IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.IntegerType.Interfaces.IntComparison;
parameter Integer u1 = 0 "First input";
parameter Integer u2 = 0 "Second input";
parameter Real Ts = 0 "Sample time";
output Boolean y = u1 >= u2 "Output";
equation
if Ts > 0 then
y = u1 >= u2;
else
y = u1 >= u2;
end if;
end GreatEq;
```
