Create a Modelica model named `DeadBand` for a dead-band controller with the following specifications:

1. **Model Functionality**: The model implements a continuous dead-band functionality. The dead-band allows for an asymmetric range. When the 'smoothed' parameter is enabled, a smooth operator is applied. During initialization, the homotopy operator simplifies the model to y = u.

2. **Inheritance and Interfaces**: The model extends `Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.SISO`.

3. **Parameters**: The model has the following parameters:
   - `uMax` (Real, start=1): Upper limit of the dead zones.
   - `uMin` (Real, default=-uMax): Lower limit of the dead zones.
   - `smoothed` (Boolean, default=false): Indicates whether the smooth operator is applied.

4. **Equations and Expressions**: The model includes the following equations:
   - An assertion to ensure that uMax is greater than or equal to uMin: `assert(uMax >= uMin, "Limits must be consistent");`
   - If `smoothed` is true, the output `y` is calculated using the `smooth` operator and `homotopy`:
  `y = homotopy(actual = smooth(0, if u < uMin then u - uMin elseif u > uMax then u - uMax else 0), simplified = u);`
   - If `smoothed` is false, the output `y` is calculated directly via `homotopy`:
  `y = homotopy(actual = if u < uMin then u - uMin elseif u > uMax then u - uMax else 0, simplified = u);`

//modelica
```model DeadBand "Dead-band controller"
  extends Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.SISO;
  Real uMax "Upper limit of the dead zones";
  Real uMin "Lower limit of the dead zones" = -uMax;
  Boolean smoothed "Indicates whether the smooth operator is applied"=false;
  equation
    assert(uMax >= uMin, "Limits must be consistent");
    y = if smoothed then homotopy(actual = smooth(0, if u < uMin then u - uMin elseif u > uMax then u - uMax else 0), simplified = u) else homotopy(actual = if u < uMin then u - uMin elseif u > uMax then u - uMax else 0, simplified = u);
  end DeadBand;
end DeadBand;
```

The model can be tested using the following code:

```
model Test
  Modelica.Blocks.Sources.RealInput u(startTime=0, k=1);
  DeadBand d(uMax=1, uMin=-1, smoothed=false);
  Real y(start=0);
equation
  connect(u, d.u);
  connect(d.y, y);
end Test;
```

The model can be simulated using Dymola and the following results are obtained:
