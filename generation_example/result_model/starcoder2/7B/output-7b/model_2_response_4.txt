Generate a Modelica function model that calculates the distances between the centers of faces in a layered structure. The model should be named `layer_fcf_distances`. The function takes an input array `s` of type `Real`, representing the thicknesses of the layers, and outputs an array `d` of type `Real` representing the distances between face centers, with `size(s, 1) + 1` elements. The function also has a protected variable n, it is an integer `n` that stores the size of the input array `s`. The function should first assign the first and last elements of `d` as half of the first and last elements of `s`, respectively. Then, for each subsequent element, calculate the average of the current and previous layer thicknesses. The model does not inherit from any other models.

//modelica
```function layer_fcf_distances
input Real s[size(s, 1) + 1];
output Real d[size(d, 1) + 1];
protected
  Integer n = size(s, 1);
initial
  d[1] = 0.5*s[1];
  d[n + 1] = 0.5*s[n];
algorithm
  for i in 2:n + 1
    d[i] = 0.5*(s[i] + s[i - 1]);
  end for;
end layer_fcf_distances;
```

## Step 3: Test your model

Now that you have a Modelica model, you can test it. To test your model, you can use the Modelica Test Framework (MTF). MTF is a testing framework that allows you to run tests on your models. You can use MTF to test your model by creating a test file that contains the test cases.

To create a test file, you can use the MTF command line tool. You can use the following command to create a test file:

```bash
mtf create -t <test_file_name>
```

where `<test_file_name>` is the name of the test file that you want to create.

Once you have created the test file, you can add test cases to the test file. You can add test cases to the test file by using the `test` function. The `test` function takes three arguments: the name of the model that you want to test, the input arguments, and the expected output arguments.

For example, if you want to test the `layer_fcf_distances` model, you can add the following test case to the test file:

```bash
test(layer_fcf_distances, {1, 2,
