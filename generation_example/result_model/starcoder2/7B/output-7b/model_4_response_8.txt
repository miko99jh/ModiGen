Generate a Modelica model named `Ctrl_Heating_TES` for a heating curve control system that manages heating based on a water storage tank. The model should extends `IDEAS.Controls.ControlHeating.Interfaces.Partial_Ctrl_Heating_TES`. The model's functionality revolves around setting temperature thresholds for both the top (`TTopSet`) and bottom (`TBotSet`) of the tank, as well as determining the heat pump setpoint (`THPSet`).

Key Parameters:
- `TTopSet`: Calculated as the maximum of `TDHWSet` (the domestic hot water setpoint) and `heatingCurve.TSup` (the supply temperature from the heating curve), plus a safety margin (`dTSafetyTop`).
- `TBotSet`: Calculated as the maximum of `TDHWSet` (the domestic hot water setpoint) and `heatingCurve.TSup` (the supply temperature from the heating curve), plus a bottom tank safety margin (`dTSafetyBot`).
- `THPSet`: The heat pump setpoint is derived from `TTopSet` with an additional margin (`dTHPTankSet`).

Control Logic:
- The `onOff` signal determines whether the heating system is activated (`onOff = 1`) or deactivated (`onOff = 0`).
- The system activates (`onOff = 1`) if the top of the tank (`TTankTop`) is below `TTopSet` and the bottom (`TTankBot`) is below `TBotSet - dTSafetyBot`, ensuring that the system operates unless there is a temperature inversion (i.e., the bottom is still very hot).
- If the heat pump is running and the top of the tank is sufficiently heated(onOff > 0.5) but the bottom is still below `TBotSet`, the system continues to run (`onOff = 1`).
- In all other scenarios, the system is shut down (`onOff = 0`).
The if statement uses the `if noEvent(...` to implement.
Ensure that the model accurately implements these temperature calculations and control logic, representing the conditions and safety margins effectively.

//modelica
```model Ctrl_Heating_TES "Control Heating Tank"
  extends IDEAS.Controls.ControlHeating.Interfaces.Partial_Ctrl_Heating_TES;

  parameter Real dTSafetyTop = 1;
  parameter Real dTSafetyBot = 1;
  parameter Real dTHPTankSet = 1;

  Real TTopSet = max(TDHWSet, heatingCurve.TSup) + dTSafetyTop;
  Real TBotSet = max(TDHWSet, heatingCurve.TSup) + dTSafetyBot;
  Real THPSet = TTopSet + dTHPTankSet;

  Real TTankTop = Tank.TTankTop;
  Real TTankBot = Tank.TTankBot;

  Real onOff = if noEvent(TTankTop > TTopSet and TTankBot > TBotSet - dTSafetyBot) then 1 else 0;

equation
  // ensure that the heat pump is only activated if the tank is sufficiently heated
  onOff = if noEvent(onOff > 0.5 and TTankTop > THPSet) then 1 else 0;

  // ensure that the heat pump is only deactivated if the tank is not sufficiently heated
  onOff = if noEvent(onOff < 0.5 and TTankTop < THPSet) then 0 else onOff;
end Ctrl_Heating_TES;
