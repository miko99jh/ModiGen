Generate a Modelica function named `Mean` to compute the mean of a vector. The function should extends `IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction`. It should have one input parameter 'u' which is a Real type vector. It should output a Real type 'y' which is the mean of the vector 'u'. The input 'u' and output 'y' exist in `RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction` and does not need to be redeclared. The algorithmic part of the function should calculate the number of elements 'n' in the vector 'u' and then compute the sum of the elements divided by 'n' as output 'y'. Where 'n' is a protected parameter of type Integer.

//modelica
```function Mean "Compute the mean of a vector"
  input Real u[n];
  output Real y;
  protected
    Integer n = size(u);
  algorithm
    y = sum(u)/n;
  end Mean;
```

The function should be tested by generating a Modelica test case. The test case should be named `MeanTest`. The test case should have one input parameter 'u' which is a Real type vector. The test case should have one output parameter 'y' which is the mean of the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'n' which is the number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected' which is the expected output of the function 'Mean'. The test case should have one parameter 'tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected output. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_n' which is the expected number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected number of elements in the input vector 'u'. The test case should have one parameter 'expected_tolerance' which is the tolerance for the expected number of elements in the input
