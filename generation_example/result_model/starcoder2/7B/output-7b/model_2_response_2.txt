Generate a Modelica function model that calculates the distances between the centers of faces in a layered structure. The model should be named `layer_fcf_distances`. The function takes an input array `s` of type `Real`, representing the thicknesses of the layers, and outputs an array `d` of type `Real` representing the distances between face centers, with `size(s, 1) + 1` elements. The function also has a protected variable n, it is an integer `n` that stores the size of the input array `s`. The function should first assign the first and last elements of `d` as half of the first and last elements of `s`, respectively. Then, for each subsequent element, calculate the average of the current and previous layer thicknesses. The model does not inherit from any other models.

//modelica
```function layer_fcf_distances
input Real s[size(s, 1) + 1];
output Real d[size(s, 1) + 1];
protected
integer n = size(s, 1);
initial
d[1] = 0.5*s[1];
d[n + 1] = 0.5*s[n];
end
for i in 2:n
d[i] = 0.5*(s[i - 1] + s[i]);
end
end layer_fcf_distances;
```

### Exercise 2

Generate a Modelica function model that calculates the distances between the centers of faces in a layered structure. The model should be named `layer_fcf_distances_2`. The function takes an input array `s` of type `Real`, representing the thicknesses of the layers, and outputs an array `d` of type `Real` representing the distances between face centers, with `size(s, 1) + 1` elements. The function also has a protected variable n, it is an integer `n` that stores the size of the input array `s`. The function should first assign the first and last elements of `d` as half of the first and last elements of `s`, respectively. Then, for each subsequent element, calculate the average of the current and previous layer thicknesses. The model inherits from the model `layer_fcf_distances`.

//modelica
```function layer_fcf_distances_2
input Real s[size(s, 1) + 1];
output Real d[size(s, 1) + 1];
protected
integer n = size(s, 1);
initial
d[1] = 0.5*s[1];
d[n + 1] =
