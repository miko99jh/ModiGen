Generate a Modelica model named `Ctrl_Heating_TES` for a heating curve control system that manages heating based on a water storage tank. The model should extends `IDEAS.Controls.ControlHeating.Interfaces.Partial_Ctrl_Heating_TES`. The model's functionality revolves around setting temperature thresholds for both the top (`TTopSet`) and bottom (`TBotSet`) of the tank, as well as determining the heat pump setpoint (`THPSet`).

Key Parameters:
- `TTopSet`: Calculated as the maximum of `TDHWSet` (the domestic hot water setpoint) and `heatingCurve.TSup` (the supply temperature from the heating curve), plus a safety margin (`dTSafetyTop`).
- `TBotSet`: Calculated as the maximum of `TDHWSet` (the domestic hot water setpoint) and `heatingCurve.TSup` (the supply temperature from the heating curve), plus a bottom tank safety margin (`dTSafetyBot`).
- `THPSet`: The heat pump setpoint is derived from `TTopSet` with an additional margin (`dTHPTankSet`).

Control Logic:
- The `onOff` signal determines whether the heating system is activated (`onOff = 1`) or deactivated (`onOff = 0`).
- The system activates (`onOff = 1`) if the top of the tank (`TTankTop`) is below `TTopSet` and the bottom (`TTankBot`) is below `TBotSet - dTSafetyBot`, ensuring that the system operates unless there is a temperature inversion (i.e., the bottom is still very hot).
- If the heat pump is running and the top of the tank is sufficiently heated(onOff > 0.5) but the bottom is still below `TBotSet`, the system continues to run (`onOff = 1`).
- In all other scenarios, the system is shut down (`onOff = 0`).
The if statement uses the `if noEvent(...` to implement.
Ensure that the model accurately implements these temperature calculations and control logic, representing the conditions and safety margins effectively.

//modelica
```model Ctrl_Heating_TES "Heating curve control system for a water storage tank"
  extends IDEAS.Controls.ControlHeating.Interfaces.Partial_Ctrl_Heating_TES;

  parameter Real dTSafetyTop = 0.5 "Top tank safety margin";
  parameter Real dTSafetyBot = 0.5 "Bottom tank safety margin";
  parameter Real dTHPTankSet = 0.5 "Tank safety margin for heat pump setpoint";

  Real TTopSet "Top tank set point";
  Real TBotSet "Bottom tank set point";
  Real THPSet "Heat pump setpoint";

  equation
    TTopSet = max(TDHWSet, heatingCurve.TSup) + dTSafetyTop;
    TBotSet = max(TDHWSet, heatingCurve.TSup) + dTSafetyBot;
    THPSet = TTopSet + dTHPTankSet;

    onOff = if noEvent(TTankTop < TTopSet and TTankBot < TBotSet - dTSafetyBot) then 1 else 0;
end Ctrl_Heating_TES;
```

## 3.2.2
Generate a Modelica model named `Ctrl_Heating_TES_with_Tank` for a heating curve control system that manages heating based on a water storage tank. The model should extend `IDEAS.Controls.ControlHeating.Interfaces.Partial_Ctrl_Heating_TES_with_Tank`. The model's functionality revolves around setting temperature thresholds for both the top (`TTopSet`) and bottom (`TBotSet`) of the tank, as well as determining the heat pump setpoint (`THPSet`).

Key Parameters:
- `TTopSet`: Calculated as the maximum of `TDHWSet` (the domestic hot water setpoint) and `heatingCurve.TSup`
