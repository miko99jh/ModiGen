Generate a Modelica function model that calculates the distances between the centers of faces in a layered structure. The model should be named `layer_fcf_distances`. The function takes an input array `s` of type `Real`, representing the thicknesses of the layers, and outputs an array `d` of type `Real` representing the distances between face centers, with `size(s, 1) + 1` elements. The function also has a protected variable n, it is an integer `n` that stores the size of the input array `s`. The function should first assign the first and last elements of `d` as half of the first and last elements of `s`, respectively. Then, for each subsequent element, calculate the average of the current and previous layer thicknesses. The model does not inherit from any other models.

output Real d[n+1];
