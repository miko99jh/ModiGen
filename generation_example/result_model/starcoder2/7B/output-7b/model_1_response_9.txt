Generate a Modelica function named `moh` to calculate the minute of an hour given a specific time. The function should correctly handle the conversion from a continuous time input to discrete minute output, factoring in the starting hour, minute, and second. The input parameters 't', 'hour_start', 'min_start', and 'sec_start' represent the current time in seconds and the initial hour, minute, and second respectively. The output 'y' should represent the minute of the current hour, ranging from 0 to 59.   Use `AES.Functions.sod` and `AES.Functions.hod` to calculate seconds of the day and hour of the day as intermediate steps(represented by two protection variables s and h), ensuring accurate minute calculation within an hour frame.

//modelica
```function moh "Minute of Hour"
input Real t;
input Real hour_start;
input Real min_start;
input Real sec_start;
output Real y;

protected
Real s;
Real h;

algorithm
s = AES.Functions.sod(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start);
h = AES.Functions.hod(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start);
y = s/60 - 60*h;
end moh;
```

## 4. Write a Modelica function named `moh_test` to test the `moh` function. The function should take a specific time as input and return the minute of the current hour. The input parameters 't', 'hour_start','min_start', and'sec_start' represent the current time in seconds and the initial hour, minute, and second respectively. The output 'y' should represent the minute of the current hour, ranging from 0 to 59.

//modelica
```function moh_test "Minute of Hour Test"
input Real t;
input Real hour_start;
input Real min_start;
input Real sec_start;
output Real y;

algorithm
y = AES.Functions.moh(t, hour_start, min_start, sec_start);
end moh_test;
```

## 5. Write a Modelica function named `hod` to calculate the hour of the day given a specific time. The function should correctly handle the conversion from a continuous time input to discrete hour output, factoring in the starting hour, minute, and second. The input parameters 't', 'hour_start','min_start', and'sec_start' represent the current time in seconds and the initial hour,
