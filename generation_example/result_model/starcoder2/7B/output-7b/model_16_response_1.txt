Generate a Modelica function named `Mean` to compute the mean of a vector. The function should extends `IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction`. It should have one input parameter 'u' which is a Real type vector. It should output a Real type 'y' which is the mean of the vector 'u'. The input 'u' and output 'y' exist in `RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction` and does not need to be redeclared. The algorithmic part of the function should calculate the number of elements 'n' in the vector 'u' and then compute the sum of the elements divided by 'n' as output 'y'. Where 'n' is a protected parameter of type Integer.

//modelica
```function Mean "Mean"
  extends IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction;
  input Real u[n] "Input vector";
  output Real y "Mean of vector";
  protected
    Integer n "Number of elements in vector";
  algorithm
    n := size(u, 1);
    y := sum(u)/n;
  end Mean;
end Mean;
```
