Generate a Modelica function named `Mean` to compute the mean of a vector. The function should extends `IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction`. It should have one input parameter 'u' which is a Real type vector. It should output a Real type 'y' which is the mean of the vector 'u'. The input 'u' and output 'y' exist in `RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction` and does not need to be redeclared. The algorithmic part of the function should calculate the number of elements 'n' in the vector 'u' and then compute the sum of the elements divided by 'n' as output 'y'. Where 'n' is a protected parameter of type Integer.

//modelica
```function Mean "Mean"
  extends IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction;
  input Real u[n];
  protected Integer n = size(u, 1);
  output Real y;
algorithm
  y = sum(u)/n;
end Mean;
```

The function should be tested in the `Test.Mean` class. The test should test the function for several vectors of different sizes. The test should also test the function for vectors of different data types.

//modelica
```class Test.Mean "Test.Mean"
  extends Modelica.Icons.Example;
  function y = Mean(u)
    extends IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction.Mean;
  protected
    Integer n = size(u, 1);
  algorithm
    y = sum(u)/n;
  end Mean;

end Test.Mean;
```

### 4.2.3. Test the function

The function should be tested in the `Test.Mean` class. The test should test the function for several vectors of different sizes. The test should also test the function for vectors of different data types.

//modelica
```class Test.Mean "Test.Mean"
  extends Modelica.Icons.Example;
  function y = Mean(u)
    extends IndustrialControlSystems.MathOperations.RealType.Functions.GeneralFunction.Mean;
  protected
    Integer n = size(u, 1);
  algorithm
    y = sum(u)/n;
  end Mean;
