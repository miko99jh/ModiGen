Generate a Modelica model for a comparison function that implements 'not equal (!=)' logic. The model should be named `NotEqual` and it should extend from the `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison` model. The inputs `u1` and `u2` are real signals, and the output 'y' is a Boolean. The input and output exist in `IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison` and does not need to be redeclared. In The equation section, the model includes a sample time parameter 'Ts', which when greater than 0, triggers the comparison at regular intervals; otherwise, the comparison is continuous. If the absolute difference between u1 and u2 is less than a small threshold (eps), the output y should be false; otherwise, it should be true.

//modelica
```model NotEqual
extends IndustrialControlSystems.Logical.Comparisons.RealType.Interfaces.RealComparison;

parameter Real eps = 1e-6;

Real u1 "Input 1"
Real u2 "Input 2"
Boolean y "Output"
parameter Real Ts = 0;

equation
when Ts > 0 then
y = abs(u1 - u2) > eps;
else
y = abs(u1 - u2) > eps;
end when;
end NotEqual;
```
