Generate a Modelica model for a relay with hysteresis functionality. The model should be named `RelayHysteresis`. It should extend the `IndustrialControlSystems.Controllers.Interfaces.BaseBlock` model. The model parameters include:
- `Ymax`: Real, the maximum output value, with a default of 1.
- `Ymin`: Real, the minimum output value, with a default of 0.
- `ThL`: Real, the low input threshold value, with a default of 0.
- `ThH`: Real, the high input threshold value, with a default of 0.
- `initState`: Boolean, the initial state of the relay, with a default of `false`.

The model should use a discrete Boolean variable `state` (initialized to `initState`) to track the relay's state, and the `state` is a protected parameter. The model should include an initial equation to set the pre-state `pre(state)` to the initial state `initState`. The model equations should support both discrete-time and continuous-time relay operations based on the sampling time `Ts`. In the discrete-time mode, when Ts is greater than zero, the relay's state is evaluated at each sampling instance. The state toggles based on the input u in relation to its thresholds: it switches on if u exceeds the high threshold ThH while the relay was previously off, or switches off if u falls below the low threshold ThL while the relay was previously on. If neither condition is met, the state remains unchanged. The output y then reflects this state, being set to Ymax when the state is true and Ymin when false. This switching is triggered by the sample(0, Ts) event. In continuous-time mode, applicable when Ts equals zero, the relay's output y directly follows its state without the need for sampling. The state toggles under similar conditions as in discrete-time: turning on when u surpasses ThH if previously off, and turning off when u drops below ThL if previously on.

//modelica
```model RelayHysteresis "Relay with hysteresis functionality"
  extends IndustrialControlSystems.Controllers.Interfaces.BaseBlock;
  parameter Real Ymax = 1 "Maximum output value";
  parameter Real Ymin = 0 "Minimum output value";
  parameter Real ThL = 0 "Low input threshold value";
  parameter Real ThH = 1 "High input threshold value";
  parameter Boolean initState = false "Initial state of the relay";
  protected parameter Boolean state = initState "State of the relay";
equation
  pre(state) = initState;
  when sample(0, Ts) then
    if (u > ThH) and (pre(state) == false) then
      state = true;
    elseif (u < ThL) and (pre(state) == true) then
      state = false;
    end if;
  end when;
  y = if state then Ymax else Ymin;
end RelayHysteresis;
```

## 2.2.2. Relay with hysteresis with reset functionality

Generate a Modelica model for a relay with hysteresis functionality and reset functionality. The model should be named `RelayHysteresisReset`. It should extend the `IndustrialControlSystems.Controllers.Interfaces.BaseBlock` model. The model parameters include:
- `Ymax`: Real, the maximum output value, with a default of 1.
- `Ymin`: Real, the minimum output value, with a default of 0.
- `ThL`: Real, the low input threshold value, with a default of 0.
- `ThH`: Real, the high input threshold value, with a default of 1.
- `initState`: Boolean, the initial state of the relay, with a default of `false`.
- `reset`: Boolean, the reset signal, with a default of `false`.
